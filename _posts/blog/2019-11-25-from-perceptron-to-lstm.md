After quite a while without a post here, I decided to come back. It has been hard to find some time for my personal projects, but my current situation led me to make this post. I'm currently a visiting PhD student at MIT and I was asked to talk about neural networks with the members of [The 77 Lab]{http://the77lab.mit.edu}, so I came up with this (long) material.

As an introduction to artificial neural networks and applications, this overview traces the whole path from one of the building blocks of artificial neural networks and then goes towards LSTMs. Check the video below.

It is interesting to see the discussions taking place along this talk with researchers from different areas/perspectives on this topic. I'm from Computer Science field, while the members of the lab are engineers. It was fun.

By the way, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to share in the comments section. If you find this video useful, please give a thumbs up, share with more people and subscribe to the channel, so I can continue posting more material here :)
